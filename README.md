# wildex

This project is about making cards of different wild animals found across the Indian sub-continent.

An example (generated using Dall-E)

The goal is to make information about wild animals around us more digestible, accessible & fun.

Not yet sure if it will be a card game or not. But the info will be in the form of cards.
